# All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List 2.9 Stable

## Description üìù

While there are honest websites who run websites that either have no advertising and tracking or have limited reasonable adverising; the modern internet is full of websites that invasively track, mislead and nag its users.

Bad websites make use of ad-networks, tracker-networks and popups.

_This is an all-in-one adblock list that thoroughly blocks trackers, popup ads, ads, unwanted cookies, fake news, cookie warning messages, typosquatters, unwanted comment sections, crypto-coin mining, YouTube clutter, Twitter guff and social network hassles._

It focuses on a "distrust website first" basis with an expected whitelisting on the users end
for approved websites. The list is aggressive and may "break" some websites that use CAPTCHAs (Google.com and the like).

## Important News üì∞

***(as of Feb 21, 2020)

2.9 is now stable, please delete the old beta link in your adblocker and import this new link:
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/master/aio.txt>

This is the final change for this link going forward, sorry for the hassle.

I've recently noticed poor performance in Firefox for youtube.com (if you use this list). In this case I'd suggest the fix of using a Chromium-based browser like Vivialdi, Opera, Edge etc.

## Features

- Very comprehensive and includes around 120 custom-picked adblocking filter lists
- Tested in Nano Adblocker for Firefox, Edge Chromium and Vivaldi; it should work just
fine in any decent adblocker that supports Adblock Plus 2.0 formatted lists
- Combines many filter lists (more that 120)
- The combined list has been sorted, with duplicates and comments removed
- The resulting list has also been cleaned up
- Many domain-only filters have been combined into one filter
- Saved in UTF-8 format
- Social media blocking rules are included
- As I'm commiting it manually updates, the list updates about once a day

**(VITAL:)**
Be sure to disable any lists that appear in the list below that you already have active in
the settings/dashboard.
