- I've changed my mind and created a __2.9 Beta__: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/master/2.9%20BETA%202020/aio.txt

- The __2.9 Beta__ has the generator (PowerShell script) rewritten from scratch
- _It generates the aio.txt file much, MUCH more quickly_
- No plans on a commit schedule to update it as I'm doing it manually
- I've combined many domain-only lines into one rule

## Description 📝

_This is an all-in-one adblock list that thoroughly blocks trackers, popup ads, ads, unwanted cookies, fake news, cookie warning messages, typosquatters, unwanted comment sections, crypto-coin mining, YouTube clutter, Twitter guff and social network hassles._

__It's been tested in uBlock Origin for Chrome, Firefox and Edge; it should work just
fine in any decent adblocker that supports Adblock Plus 2.0 formatted lists.__

It's the result of the ad filter lists being combined, sorted, with duplicates and comments removed.

It's saved in UTF-8 format.

**(VITAL:)**
Be sure to disable any lists that appear in the list below that you already have active in
the settings/dashboard. e.g. <https://i.imgur.com/cVyxL7J.png>

This list is very comprehensive and includes around 120 custom-picked adblocking filter lists.
As a basic rule this list includes filter lists that are obtainable at time of generation.

This list focuses on a "distrust website first" basis with an expected whitelisting on the users end
for approved websites. The list is aggressive and may "break" some websites that use CAPTCHAs (Google.com and the like).

I've recently noticed poor performance in Firefox for youtube.com (if you use this list). In this case I'd suggest the fix of using a Chromium-based browser like Vivialdi, Opera, Edge etc.

## Usage 📣

In your adblocker's filter lists section add the URL:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/master/2.9%20BETA%202020/aio.txt>

## What's in Version 2.9 Beta 📌

Version 2.9 Beta of the AIO list is more complete and potent than ever.

* Added more adblocking lists (over 120 in total now)
* Tested browsers: Firefox, Vivaldi, Opera and Chrome
* Tested addons/extensions: uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus

All the above combined down to a simplified list.

## Credits ☺️

Full credit for the actual blocking ability goes to original list creators and maintainers. Thanks so much for their tireless work! :D
